# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

## About Me :wave:
I am a motivated and detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics,
with a background in customs operations and international business.

My strongest analytical foundation is Excel, which I have used extensively for data
analysis and reporting in a business environment.

In my previous role, I worked with Power BI both as a business user and at a junior
development level. I used dashboards and reports to support daily operations and
decision-making, and I was also involved in making basic report adjustments and
enhancements within a business environment, gaining initial hands-on experience
beyond end-user usage.

Currently, I am developing my skills as a Power BI developer, with a focus on data
modeling, DAX, and building clear, business-oriented dashboards.

I also have basic experience with SQL and Python, which I continue to develop as
supporting tools for data analysis and data preparation.

This portfolio showcases selected projects, with a primary focus on Power BI,
reflecting my transition from Power BI user to junior Power BI developer.
Over time, the portfolio will be expanded with additional projects in SQL and
other data analysis tools.

## Projects :bar_chart:

### Power BI - Project 1: Car Parts EU – export analysis
#### Data source:
Simulated dataset for CarParts EU (2022-2025).

The data set includes:
- Basic information on CarParts EU exports from various EU countries to Great Britain
- Offers and costs of two different brokers
- Demurrage costs
- Information on trailers affected by customs inspections

#### Project Goal:
- Create a tab for Higher Management to compare two Spanish brokers, enabling decisions on whether the smaller broker from Barcelona should take over the services in Madrid, or if the Madrid services should remain with the larger European broker.
- Create a tab for Lower-level Management to monitor standard metrics (WBR, MBR) across all export countries.

### Project 2 – TBD
