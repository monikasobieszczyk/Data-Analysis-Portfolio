# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

I am a motivated and detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics,
with a background in customs operations and international business.

My strongest analytical foundation is Excel, which I have used extensively for data
analysis and reporting in a business environment.

In my previous role, I worked with Power BI both as a business user and at a junior
development level. I used dashboards and reports to support daily operations and
decision-making, and I was also involved in making basic report adjustments and
enhancements within a business environment, gaining initial hands-on experience
beyond end-user usage.

Currently, I am developing my skills as a Power BI developer, with a focus on data
modeling, DAX, and building clear, business-oriented dashboards.

I also have basic experience with SQL and Python, which I continue to develop as
supporting tools for data analysis and data preparation.

This portfolio showcases selected projects, with a primary focus on Power BI,
reflecting my transition from Power BI user to junior Power BI developer.
Over time, the portfolio will be expanded with additional projects in SQL and
other data analysis tools.
