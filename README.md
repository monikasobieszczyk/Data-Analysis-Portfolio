# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

## About Me :wave:
I am a motivated and detail-oriented professional transitioning into data analytics,
with a background in customs operations and international business.

My strongest analytical foundation is Excel, which I have used extensively for data
analysis and reporting in a business environment.

In my previous role, I worked with Power BI both as a business user and at a junior
development level. I used dashboards and reports to support daily operations and
decision-making, and I was also involved in making basic report adjustments and
enhancements within a business environment, gaining initial hands-on experience
beyond end-user usage.

Currently, I am developing my skills as a Power BI developer, with a focus on data
modeling, DAX, and building clear, business-oriented dashboards.

I also have basic experience with SQL and Python, which I continue to develop as
supporting tools for data analysis and data preparation.

This portfolio showcases selected projects, with a primary focus on Power BI,
reflecting my transition from Power BI user to junior Power BI developer.
Over time, the portfolio will be expanded with additional projects in SQL and
other data analysis tools.

## Projects :bar_chart:

### (I) Power BI

### >> Power BI Project 1: Car Parts EU – export analysis
#### Data source:
Simulated dataset for CarParts EU (2022-2025).

The data set includes:
- Basic information on CarParts EU exports from various EU countries to Great Britain
- Offers and costs of two different brokers
- Demurrage costs
- Information on trailers affected by customs inspections

#### Project Goal:
- Create a tab for Higher Management to compare two Spanish brokers, enabling decisions on whether the smaller broker from Barcelona should take over the services in Madrid, or if the Madrid services should remain with the larger European broker.
- Create a tab for Lower-level Management to monitor standard metrics (WBR, MBR) across all export countries.

#### Tools / Skills
Power BI, Excel

### >> Power BI Project 2: The Berka dataset analysis
#### Data Source

#### Dataset Documentation
[Documentation](https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mirsad/itcs6265/group1/index.html)
#### Project Goal:
The Berka dataset, from the 1999 PKDD Discovery Challenge, contains information on clients, accounts, and transactions of a Czech bank. 
The original task description aimed to help the bank improve services by identifying good clients (to offer additional services) and bad clients (to monitor to minimize losses). 
Following this goal, our project focused on analyzing bank data from different perspective eg. to identify customers who are good candidates for credit card offers.
#### Main tasks:
- Load data (ETL – Extract, Transform, Load)
- Create relationships and prepare the data model
- Clean and preprocess data
- Analyze customer transactions, including:
  - Receipts and payments on accounts
  - Customers with the most / fewest transactions
  - Regions with the most active customers
  - Types of cards used
  - Loans and other products held by customers
#### Tools / Skills
Power BI, Excel
